                Yasin’s family moved from Iraq to England when he was just a young boy.
                Yasin did not want to leave his home in Samarra but his father said that it was best for the family because it was not safe to live there anymore and he wanted his son to grow up in a country that was accepting of all people. Yasin’s father told his son that England was a 
                multicultural country where people lived and worked together regardless of race or religious beliefs.

                Although Yasin was not happy about leaving Iraq, he soon settled into his new life in a big city called London. 
                London was very exciting with its tall buildings and museums, 
                and Yasin especially liked the London Planetarium and the big River Thames with all of its old bridges.
